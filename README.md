Hello, welcome to my GitHub!

I have posted my submission to the University of Waterloo's Data Science Club Hackathon project in collaboration with Infinite Investments!

The folder contains the datasets my teammate and I used to train and test our model - resulting in a 90%+ F1-Score. We used several models including Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBMClassifier and CatBoost.
They were all marginally similar but eventually, CatBoost triumphed as the better model for our dataset since our predictors were mainly categorical.
